        <h2>Mammals: Warm-Blooded and Diverse</h2>
        <p class="long">
          Mammals are a highly successful class of vertebrates distinguished by
          the presence of hair or fur, three middle ear bones, and mammary
          glands that produce milk. They include solitary hunters and complex
          social species, and occupy nearly every terrestrial and aquatic
          habitat. Fossil records show mammals diversified dramatically after
          the end of the age of dinosaurs, leading to many adaptive radiations.
        </p>
        <p class="long">
          Social structures among mammals vary widely: elephants and primates
          form tight family groups with extended parental care, while many small
          mammals are short-lived and breed quickly. Feeding strategies range
          from strict herbivory (e.g., deer, koalas) to specialized carnivory
          (e.g., felids, cetaceans) and omnivory (e.g., bears). Several mammals
          have developed unique adaptations — echolocation in bats, complex
          vocal learning in whales and some primates, and burrowing in moles and
          some rodent species.
        </p>
        <p class="long">
          Conservation status also varies: some mammals like house mice thrive
          alongside humans, while others such as rhinos and certain primates
          face severe threats from habitat loss and poaching. Reintroduction and
          protected-area strategies have helped recover some populations, but
          many species remain endangered.

        <h2>Birds: Feathers, Flight, and Migration</h2>
        <p class="long">
          Birds are feathered vertebrates whose bodies and behaviors are shaped
          by flight, even in species that no longer fly. Feathers provide
          insulation, enable flight mechanics, and are also used in display and
          camouflage. The avian respiratory system, with air sacs and
          unidirectional airflow, supports the high metabolic demands of flight.
        </p>
        <p class="long">
          Migration is a hallmark of many bird species: shorebirds, passerines,
          and raptors travel thousands of kilometers between breeding and
          wintering grounds. Navigation uses a mix of cues — the sun, stars,
          magnetic fields, and visual landmarks. Some birds, like albatrosses,
          spend months at sea with wide-ranging foraging strategies, while
          others remain territorial year-round.
        </p>
        <p class="long">
          Nesting and parental care differ: many passerines build cup nests and
          both parents feed chicks, whereas megapodes use environmental heat to
          incubate eggs. Human impacts — habitat fragmentation, window
          collisions, and introduced predators — have driven declines for many
          species, prompting conservation measures like protected flyways and
          predator control on breeding islands.
        </p>

        <h2>Reptiles: Scales, Thermoregulation, and Survival</h2>
        <p class="long">
          Reptiles are a diverse group including snakes, lizards, turtles, and
          crocodilians. Their scaly skin helps reduce water loss, allowing many
          to thrive in arid environments. As ectotherms, reptiles rely on
          external heat sources to regulate body temperature; basking,
          shade-seeking, and seasonal dormancy (brumation) are common behaviors.
        </p>
        <p class="long">
          Reptilian reproduction encompasses egg-laying and, in some species,
          live birth. Temperature-dependent sex determination occurs in many
          turtles and crocodilians — a small shift in incubation temperature can
          bias hatchling sex ratios. Venom has evolved independently in several
          reptile lineages, used for prey capture and defense.
        </p>
        <p class="long">
          Turtles and tortoises are long-lived reptiles with slow reproductive
          rates, making them vulnerable to overharvesting. Crocodilians are apex
          predators in many freshwater systems and play important ecological
          roles as ecosystem engineers by creating waterholes and controlling
          prey populations.
        </p>

        <h2>Amphibians: Sensitive Indicators</h2>
        <p class="long">
          Amphibians — frogs, toads, salamanders, and caecilians — typically
          have a life cycle that includes an aquatic larval stage and a
          terrestrial or semi-aquatic adult stage. Their permeable skin makes
          them highly sensitive to pollutants, pathogens, and changes in
          moisture, so amphibian declines often signal broader environmental
          problems.
        </p>
        <p class="long">
          Many amphibians have intricate reproductive behaviors: foam nests,
          direct development where eggs hatch into miniature adults, and
          elaborate courtship calls in frogs. Chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium
          dendrobatidis) and habitat destruction have caused dramatic declines
          and extinctions in amphibian populations worldwide, spurring
          captive-breeding and reintroduction programs.
        </p>
        <p class="long">
          Conservation for amphibians emphasizes protecting breeding habitats
          (ponds, streams), maintaining landscape connectivity, and monitoring
          disease. Some species are micro-endemics, restricted to single streams
          or mountaintops, and therefore especially susceptible to climate
          change.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Fish: Scales, Gills, and Vast Diversity</h2>
        <p class="long">
          Fish represent a huge diversity of body forms and life histories; they
          occupy fresh and marine waters from shallow reefs to the deep sea.
          Gills extract oxygen from water, and many species display complex life
          cycles including larval dispersal stages. Fish diets range from
          plankton to large prey, and feeding adaptations include
          filter-feeding, suction feeding, and specialized crushing jaws.
        </p>
        <p class="long">
          Schooling behavior in many fish species provides predator avoidance
          and foraging efficiency. Some fish migrate long distances to spawn —
          salmon return from the ocean to natal rivers, while eels undertake
          trans-oceanic migrations with elusive breeding grounds. Coral reef
          fishes often have complex symbioses and niche partitioning that
          sustain high local biodiversity.
        </p>
        <p class="long">
          Overfishing, habitat degradation, and climate change (warming,
          acidification) threaten many fish stocks. Fisheries management, marine
          protected areas, and sustainable aquaculture are tools used to
          maintain populations and ecosystem health.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Invertebrates: The Often-Overlooked Majority</h2>
        <p class="long">
          Invertebrates — animals without a vertebral column — include insects,
          arachnids, mollusks, crustaceans, annelids, and many others. They make
          up the vast majority of animal species and perform critical ecosystem
          services: pollination, decomposition, soil formation, and serving as
          food for higher trophic levels.
        </p>
        <p class="long">
          Insects alone exhibit extraordinary diversity: beetles (Coleoptera)
          represent one of the largest groups of described species, while
          Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) and Hymenoptera (bees, wasps,
          ants) show complex life cycles and social systems. Cephalopods
          (octopus, squid) are notable for intelligence, problem-solving, and
          rapid camouflage.
        </p>
        <p class="long">
          Conservation of invertebrates is often underfunded despite their
          ecological importance. Habitat loss, pesticide use, and invasive
          species can rapidly reduce invertebrate abundance, which cascades
          through food webs and affects pollination and nutrient cycling.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Habitats and Interactions</h2>
        <p class="long">
          Animals exist within ecosystems shaped by climate, vegetation, water
          availability, and geological features. Trophic interactions — who eats
          whom — structure communities, while mutualisms (e.g., pollinators and
          flowering plants) create critical dependencies. Keystone species can
          disproportionately shape habitat structure: beavers build wetlands;
          sea otters control sea urchins to protect kelp forests.
        </p>
        <p class="long">
          Behavioral ecology examines how animals allocate time and energy to
          foraging, mating, and caring for offspring. Life-history strategies
          balance survival and reproduction: r-selected species reproduce
          rapidly with many offspring, while K-selected species invest heavily
          in fewer young. Human activities alter these dynamics through habitat
          fragmentation, resource extraction, and climate forcing.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Conservation and Human Connections</h2>
        <p class="long">
          Conservation biology integrates ecology, genetics, and social policy
          to protect species and ecosystems. Approaches include protected areas,
          species recovery plans, captive breeding, ecological restoration, and
          community-led conservation that aligns local livelihoods with
          biodiversity outcomes. Ecotourism, when responsibly managed, can fund
          protection while educating the public.
        </p>
        <p class="long">
          Humans depend on animals directly (food, materials, labor) and
          indirectly (pollination, pest control, cultural value). Recognizing
          the intrinsic and utilitarian values of animals helps frame policies
          that aim to preserve biodiversity for future generations while
          supporting human well-being.
